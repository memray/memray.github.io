I'm a Ph.D student at [School of Information Sciences](http://ischool.pitt.edu), [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu). I am advised by Dr. [Daqing He](http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~daqing/) and a member of [Information Retrieval, Integration and Synthesis Lab](http://crystal.exp.sis.pitt.edu:8080/iris/).

Currently my research focuses on natural language processing, information retrieval and text mining. Especially I am interested in Deep Learning for Semantic Representation and Information Extraction.

Before coming to Pittsburgh, I received my bachelor and master degree from [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn/) (regarded as one of the most beautiful campuses and top universities for decades in China), and I worked
with Prof. [Wei Lu](http://www.sim.whu.edu.cn/index.php/index-view-aid-239.html).
